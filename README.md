# Algorithm

The project to play with data structure & algorithms. 

Now includes(updating):

 * **Data Structure:** some complex data structures, e.g. trie. Refer to "datastruct" package for more. 
 * **Search Algorithm:** classic search algorithm including: linear search, Insertion search, binary search, etc. Refer to "search" package for more.
 * **Sort Algorithm:** classic sort algorithm including bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc. Refer to "sort" package for more.
 * **Classic Problem:** practices with some classic algorithm problems, e.g.0-1 knapsack problem, levenshtein distance problem. 
 Refer to "practices" package for more.
